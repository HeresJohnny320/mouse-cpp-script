# Custom CB Mic Setup for ATS and ETS2

I wanted to share a little project I worked on. I created my own CB mic setup for **American Truck Simulator (ATS)** and **Euro Truck Simulator 2 (ETS2)** using an old CB mic and an old mouse. The goal was to repurpose stuff I already had lying around and make it work for TruckersMP or Convoy.

Using this setup, I made the **middle mouse button act as "X"** for in-game cb radio.  

You’re welcome to use this code however you want—modify it, improve it, or just take ideas from it. If you have suggestions to make it better, feel free to update it!

## Notes
- This is a personal project, so it’s pretty DIY.  
- Works best with an old mouse that you don’t mind repurposing.  
- Designed specifically for TruckersMP/Convoy, but the code can be adapted for other uses.  

Enjoy, and happy trucking!
